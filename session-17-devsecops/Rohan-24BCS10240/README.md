| **Session** | 17 — DevSecOps (secure CI/CD pipeline) |
| **Branch** | `main` |
| **Workflow file** | [`.github/workflows/24bcs10240-session17-devsecops.yml`](../../.github/workflows/24bcs10240-session17-devsecops.yml) |

## Task checklist

- [x] Pipeline in this exact order: **Build → Unit Test → SAST → SCA → Secret scan → Docker build → Image scan → Security gate → Push → Deploy**
- [x] SAST: **Semgrep**, custom rules in [`.semgrep.yml`](.semgrep.yml) plus the community `p/python` ruleset
- [x] SCA: **Trivy fs** (gating) and **pip-audit** (informational)
- [x] Secret scanning: **Gitleaks** with [`.gitleaks.toml`](.gitleaks.toml), scoped to this folder only
- [x] Container image scanning: **Trivy image** with [`trivy.yaml`](trivy.yaml), policy HIGH/CRITICAL
- [x] Security gate: one job that `needs` all four scans and fails on HIGH/CRITICAL, Semgrep ERROR, or any secret. It also fails closed if a scanner crashes.
- [x] Push to **GHCR** (`ghcr.io/rohansst/s17-devsecops-demo-24bcs10240`) with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, only after the gate passes
- [x] Deploy to Kubernetes (kind cluster in the runner). Manifests use `runAsNonRoot`, `readOnlyRootFilesystem`, drop ALL capabilities, resource limits, and readiness/liveness probes. The image is pinned by digest. Hardening is checked at runtime.
- [x] Scan reports (SARIF + JSON + text) uploaded as artifacts
- [x] Gate shown working: a **red run** (vulnerable dependency + debug mode + fake token) followed by a **green run** after the fix
- [x] Trivy run locally (installed with Homebrew), real output included
- [x] No `.trivyignore`: the image has 0 HIGH/CRITICAL findings, so nothing needs suppressing

### Gate design

Every scan job runs its tool in **report mode**. It always writes JSON, SARIF and text reports, uploads them as an artifact, and publishes two job outputs: `findings` (a count) and `result` (`pass`/`fail`). Findings appear as `::error` annotations on the file and line. Because the scan jobs don't stop the chain, **every scanner runs on every commit**, and the gate sees the whole picture instead of only the first failure.

The `security-gate` job uses `needs: [sast, sca, secret-scan, image-scan]` and `if: always()`. It fails if any check has `job != success` **or** `result != pass`:

| Check | Tool | Blocking policy |
|---|---|---|
| SAST | Semgrep | any finding with severity `ERROR` (WARNINGs are reported only) |
| SCA | Trivy fs | any `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` dependency CVE |
| Secrets | Gitleaks | any secret |
| Image | Trivy image | any `HIGH` or `CRITICAL` CVE (OS packages and Python packages; unfixed CVEs count too) |

It is **fail-closed**. If a scanner itself crashes, its job result is `failure` and the gate fails. That happened for real in run 37456596427 (see §5.2). `push` has `needs: security-gate`, and `deploy` has `needs: push`, so nothing reaches the registry or the cluster unless the gate passes.

`push` runs only on `push`/`workflow_dispatch` events (not on pull requests). It loads the **same image tarball that was scanned** from the `docker-image` artifact, so the image that gets pushed is byte-for-byte the image that was scanned. `deploy` pins the image by **digest** (`@sha256:…`), not by tag.

---

## 3. Tools and config files

### SAST: Semgrep (`.semgrep.yml`)
Semgrep reads source code without running it (pattern matching over the code's syntax tree). The pipeline runs `semgrep scan --config .semgrep.yml --config p/python app tests`. That is 156 rules: 5 custom ones plus the community Python ruleset.

| Custom rule | Severity | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| `s17-flask-debug-enabled` | ERROR | `app.run(debug=True)`, `app.debug = True` (Werkzeug debugger allows remote code execution, CWE-489) |
| `s17-subprocess-shell-true` | ERROR | `subprocess.*(shell=True)`, `os.system` (CWE-78) |
| `s17-unsafe-yaml-load` | ERROR | `yaml.load` without `SafeLoader` (CWE-502) |
| `s17-eval-exec` | ERROR | `eval` / `exec` (CWE-95) |
| `s17-hardcoded-credential` | WARNING | `password/secret/token/api_key = "..."` (CWE-798) |

### SCA: Trivy fs + pip-audit
- **Trivy fs** (gating): `trivy fs --config trivy.yaml .` reads `requirements.txt` and matches the pinned packages against the Trivy vulnerability DB (NVD, GitHub advisories, and others), which includes severities.
- **pip-audit** (informational): resolves the **full dependency tree** (including transitive packages) against the PyPI/OSV advisory DB. pip-audit reports no severity, so it would not fit a "HIGH/CRITICAL" policy. It raises a `::warning` and uploads `pip-audit.json`, and the gate does not use it. Transitive packages are still gated, because the image scan in step 7 sees every package installed in the image.

### Secret scanning: Gitleaks (`.gitleaks.toml`)
- `[extend] useDefault = true` keeps all built-in rules (AWS, GitHub, Slack, private keys, JWT, generic API keys, and so on).
- A custom rule `s17-demo-api-token` (`s17demo_[a-f0-9]{32}`) adds an organisation-specific token format. The red demo uses it, so it never needs a real-looking provider credential (which GitHub push protection would also block).
- **Scoped to this folder**: the job runs `gitleaks dir .` from `session-17-devsecops/Rohan-24BCS10240`. Other students' files in the shared repo are not scanned. `--redact` keeps the secret value out of the logs.
- Note: `dir` mode scans the current tree. After the fix commit the token no longer appears, but it is **still in git history** (commit `b053d7e`). For a real credential, deleting it is not enough: rotate or revoke it first, then clean the history (course §06). Here the token is fake and grants access to nothing.

### Container image scanning: Trivy (`trivy.yaml`)
```yaml
severity: [HIGH, CRITICAL]
exit-code: 1
scan: { scanners: [vuln] }
vulnerability: { ignore-unfixed: false }   # strict: unfixed CVEs count too
db: { repository: [mirror.gcr.io/aquasec/trivy-db] }
```
The same file drives the local scan, `trivy fs` and `trivy image`. In CI, `--exit-code 0` is passed so the job can always write its reports, and the gate applies the policy.

Trivy and Gitleaks are installed from their **GitHub release tarballs, checked against the published SHA-256 checksums**. The third-party `trivy-action` / `gitleaks-action` wrappers are not used.

### Why the base image is `python:3.12-alpine` (real local Trivy result)

I first tried the Debian slim base. Local scan (`trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL`):

```text
python:3.12-slim (debian 13.7)
==============================
Total: 44 (HIGH: 44, CRITICAL: 0)
```

Those findings are in OS packages such as `util-linux`, `libsystemd0` and `ncurses`, most with status `affected` (no fix available). My first slim-based image also had 4 HIGH findings in `pip`/`setuptools` and their vendored `urllib3`/`msgpack`. Switching to `python:3.12-alpine`, running `apk upgrade` and **removing pip/setuptools from the runtime image** brought it to **0 HIGH/CRITICAL** without any `.trivyignore`.

---

## 4. Kubernetes hardening (`k8s/deployment.yaml`)

| Control | Setting |
|---|---|
| Non-root | pod and container `runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser/runAsGroup: 10001` (the image also sets `USER 10001:10001`) |
| Read-only root FS | `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true`; only `/tmp` is writable (in-memory `emptyDir`, 16Mi) for gunicorn's worker heartbeat files |
| Privilege | `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `privileged: false`, `capabilities.drop: [ALL]`, `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault` |
| Resources | requests `50m / 64Mi`, limits `250m / 192Mi` |
| Probes | readiness and liveness on `GET /health` |
| API access | `automountServiceAccountToken: false` |
| Supply chain | image pinned by digest; private GHCR pull via `imagePullSecret` created from the job's `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`packages: read`) |

The deploy job **checks these settings on the running pod** (`kubectl get pod -o jsonpath=…securityContext`, `id`, and a `touch /app/...` that must fail). See §5.3.

The app adds `X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options` and `Content-Security-Policy` headers and HTML-escapes user input in `/api/greet/<name>`. gunicorn runs with `--no-control-socket`, because gunicorn 26 would otherwise try to create a socket in `$HOME`, which is read-only.

| 2 | `b053d7e` **INTENTIONALLY insecure** (vulnerable dep, debug mode, fake token) | ❌ gate failed. Trivy `convert` crashed the SCA job, so the gate failed closed | [37456596427](https://github.com/RohanSingh0208/devops-heros/actions/runs/37456596427) |
| 3 | `df858d7` fix `trivy convert` exit code (insecure code still present) | ❌ **all four scans flagged it → Security Gate FAILED → push and deploy skipped** | [37456952216](https://github.com/RohanSingh0208/devops-heros/actions/runs/37456952216) |
| 4 | `9b2a457` remediate: drop vulnerable dep, debug mode and token | ✅ **gate PASSED → pushed → deployed** | [37457356020](https://github.com/RohanSingh0208/devops-heros/actions/runs/37457356020) |

### 5.1 Red run: the gate blocks the release ([run 37456952216](https://github.com/RohanSingh0208/devops-heros/actions/runs/37456952216))

The insecure commit added `requests==2.19.1` to `requirements.txt`, `app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080, debug=True)` to `main.py`, and `app/settings.py` with `DEMO_API_TOKEN = "s17demo_<32 hex chars, redacted here>"`.

### 5.2 Fail-closed in practice ([run 37456596427](https://github.com/RohanSingh0208/devops-heros/actions/runs/37456596427))

On the first push of the insecure commit, `trivy convert --format table` inherited `exit-code: 1` from `trivy.yaml` and exited 1 when it found the vulnerability. The **SCA job itself failed**, the following scan jobs were skipped, and the gate still failed, because it treats a job that did not succeed as FAIL:

```text
3. SAST (Semgrep): success        4. SCA (pip-audit + Trivy fs): failure
5. Secret Scan (Gitleaks): skipped   6. Docker Build: skipped   7. Container Image Scan (Trivy): skipped
8. Security Gate: failure         9. Push Image (GHCR): skipped   10. Deploy: skipped
gate env: SAST_RES=fail SAST_N=1  SCA_JOB=failure  SEC_JOB=skipped
```

Fix: `trivy convert --exit-code 0 …` (the gate job applies the policy). Run #3 then showed every scanner's report.

### 5.3 Green run after remediation ([run 37457356020](https://github.com/RohanSingh0208/devops-heros/actions/runs/37457356020), commit `9b2a457`)

## 7. Notes and limitations

- **kind** gives a real Kubernetes API server, scheduler and kubelet inside the GitHub runner, so `apply`, `rollout status`, `exec` and probes are real. The cluster is deleted when the job ends. A persistent cluster would replace the kind step with a kubeconfig stored as a secret.
- The annotation `The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128` comes from `actions/checkout` post-job cleanup. It hits a broken submodule entry that already exists in the upstream repo (`session-16-github-actions/mini-project 10-33-34-265`). It is harmless and unrelated to this project.
- In §5.1 some wide Trivy table rows are condensed (padding and wrapped title lines removed) so they fit the page. The values are unchanged from the run log.
- The SARIF files are not uploaded to GitHub code scanning. They are kept as downloadable artifacts, so this demo does not add alerts to the shared fork's Security tab.
