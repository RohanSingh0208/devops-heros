# Session 16 — CI/CD with GitHub Actions

| **Student** | Rohan Singh |
| **Enrollment No.** | 24BCS10240 |
| **Session** | 16 — CI/CD & GitHub Actions |
| **Branch** | `main` |
| **Workflow file** | [`.github/workflows/24bcs10240-session16-cicd.yml`](../../.github/workflows/24bcs10240-session16-cicd.yml) |

## Task checklist

- [x] CI vs CD: explained, and both run in one pipeline
- [x] Pipeline: lint → test → build → push → deploy, chained with `needs`
- [x] Workflow: triggered by `push`, `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch`, filtered by branch and path
- [x] Jobs and steps: 4 jobs (`ci`, `build`, `deliver`, `deploy`), each made of named steps
- [x] Runners: build matrix on **ubuntu-latest + windows-latest** × **Node 20 + Node 22** (4 parallel runners)
- [x] Secrets: repo secret `APP_GREETING` → Kubernetes Secret → container env var (never printed). `GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to push to GHCR
- [x] Artifacts: JUnit + coverage report for each matrix leg, and the Docker image tarball
- [x] Build: `docker build` plus a container smoke test
- [x] Test: Jest unit and HTTP tests with a coverage threshold (80% lines)
- [x] CD: image pushed to `ghcr.io/rohansst/s16-cicd-demo-24bcs10240`, then deployed to a kind cluster in the runner with `kubectl apply`, `rollout status` and a curl smoke test
- [x] Execution: green run, red run (bug added on purpose), and green again after the fix. All runs below are real.

cd session-16-github-actions/Rohan-24BCS10240
npm ci
npm run lint
npm test                      # jest --ci --coverage -> reports/junit.xml + coverage/

## 2. Concepts

### CI vs CD

| | Continuous Integration (CI) | Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD) |
|---|---|---|
| Goal | Every change is checked automatically | Every change that passes CI can be released |
| In this pipeline | `ci` job: install, lint, unit tests, coverage on 4 runners; `build` job: Docker image + container smoke test | `deliver` job: push image to GHCR (**delivery**); `deploy` job: roll it out to Kubernetes and smoke-test it (**deployment**) |
| Runs on | push, pull_request, manual | only `push` / `workflow_dispatch` (`if:`). Pull requests stop after `build` |

### Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[git push] --> W[GitHub Actions workflow]
    subgraph CI["CI (matrix: 2 OS x 2 Node)"]
      C1[ubuntu / node 20]
      C2[ubuntu / node 22]
      C3[windows / node 20]
      C4[windows / node 22]
    end
    W --> CI
    CI -->|needs: ci| B[build<br/>docker build + smoke test<br/>artifact: docker-image]
    B -->|needs: build<br/>push only| D[deliver<br/>push to GHCR]
    D -->|needs: deliver| K[deploy<br/>kind + kubectl apply<br/>rollout status + curl]
```

If any matrix leg fails, `build`, `deliver` and `deploy` are **skipped**. The red run below shows this.

### Workflow, jobs, steps, runners

- **Workflow**: the YAML file at `.github/workflows/24bcs10240-session16-cicd.yml`. GitHub only reads workflows from the repo root, so the file lives there. `defaults.run.working-directory` points every `run:` step at this folder.
- **Triggers**: `push` (only branch `session16`), `pull_request` and `workflow_dispatch`. All of them use a `paths` filter on this folder and the workflow file. `!**/*.md` stops README-only commits from starting the pipeline.
- **Jobs**: `ci`, `build`, `deliver`, `deploy`. Each job gets a fresh VM. Jobs share data only through **artifacts** (the image tarball) or **outputs** (`deliver.outputs.image` gives the image tag to `deploy`).
- **Steps**: either `uses:` (a reusable action such as `actions/checkout@v6`, `actions/setup-node@v6`, `docker/login-action@v4` or `helm/kind-action@v1`) or `run:` (shell commands).
- **Runners**: GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`. The `ci` job uses `strategy.matrix` (`os` × `node`) with `fail-fast: false`, so all 4 legs report even if one fails.

### Secrets

| Secret | Kind | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_GREETING` | repo secret, created with `gh secret set APP_GREETING -R RohanSingh0208/devops-heros` | Passed to `kubectl create secret generic s16-app-secrets`. The Deployment reads it with `secretKeyRef`. The app reports only `greetingSource: "secret"`, and the smoke test checks that field. The value itself is never echoed (it shows as `***` in logs). |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | provided automatically, scoped per job by `permissions:` | `packages: write` in `deliver` to push to GHCR; `packages: read` in `deploy` to create the `ghcr-pull` imagePullSecret (the package is private) |

The workflow sets `permissions: contents: read` at the top level, so each job gets read-only access unless it asks for more (least privilege).

### Artifacts

| Artifact | Produced by | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `test-report-<os>-node<ver>` (×4) | each `ci` matrix leg (`if: always()`, so it uploads on failure too) | `reports/junit.xml`, `coverage/lcov.info`, `coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml`, HTML coverage |
| `docker-image` | `build` | `s16-cicd-demo.tar.gz` (`docker save`). `deliver` downloads it and pushes it, so the image that was tested is the image that gets shipped. |

`greetingSource=secret` shows that the GitHub secret reached the pod through the Kubernetes Secret. The secret value itself is never printed.

### 3.6 Artifacts of the green run (`gh api repos/RohanSingh0208/devops-heros/actions/runs/37454511045/artifacts`)

```

### 3.7 Red run: failure scenario ([run 37454306002](https://github.com/RohanSingh0208/devops-heros/actions/runs/37454306002))

Following the reference project's failure scenario, `add()` was changed to `return a + b + 1;`:

```text
CI (windows-latest, node 22): failure
CI (windows-latest, node 20): failure
CI (ubuntu-latest, node 22): failure
CI (ubuntu-latest, node 20): failure
Build Docker image: skipped
Push image to GHCR: skipped
Deploy to Kubernetes (kind): skipped
```

```text
CI (ubuntu-latest, node 22)	Unit tests with coverage	    ✕ add (5 ms)
CI (ubuntu-latest, node 22)	Unit tests with coverage	    ✕ GET /api/add computes a sum (4 ms)
CI (windows-latest, node 22)	Unit tests with coverage	    Expected: 15
CI (windows-latest, node 22)	Unit tests with coverage	    Received: 16
CI (windows-latest, node 22)	Unit tests with coverage	Tests:       2 failed, 10 passed, 12 total
```

Because of `needs: ci`, the broken code was never built, pushed or deployed. The test-report artifacts were still uploaded (`if: always()`), so the failure can be inspected afterwards. Reverting the bug produced green run #4.

### Notes

- The annotation `The process '/usr/bin/git' failed with exit code 128` comes from the post-checkout cleanup. It hits a broken submodule entry that already exists in the upstream repo (`session-16-github-actions/mini-project 10-33-34-265` has no `.gitmodules` URL). It is a warning only and does not affect the pipeline.
- The GHCR package is private by default. That is why `deploy` creates a `ghcr-pull` imagePullSecret from the job's `GITHUB_TOKEN` (`packages: read`).
